## 👋 Hi there, I’m Boa Kim 

I enjoy building end-to-end services that make a real impact.
To me, software development isn’t just about writing code — it’s about creating products that work seamlessly in the real world, deliver real value, and make people’s everyday lives easier.

I’m also deeply interested in product management and other IT-related fields, as I love bridging the gap between technical development and strategic product thinking.

My goal is to build services that are not only functional, but also engaging and meaningful to people.
