I enjoy building end-to-end services. To me, software development is not just about coding but about creating products that run in real-world environments, deliver genuine value, enhance people’s experiences, and generate revenue. I am also deeply interested in product management and the broader IT landscape, as I like connecting technological development with strategic product thinking. My goal is to create services that are not only functional but also engaging and impactful in the real world.
